* When is it more work to stay put  
* than to move?
<hr>
* When currents become strong,  
* aquatic snails retract into their shells,  
* letting go of whatever they were holding onto.  
* They know it's safer to let the water carry them off  
* than risk staying put, becoming stranded, high and dry.
