> A man must dream a long time in order to act with grandeur, and dreaming is nursed in darkness.

~<cite>Jean Genet</cite>

*dreaming is nursed in darkness*.  
dreams by nature are ethereal,  
not quite known. a dream fully  
understood is rather a vision,  
a goal. dreams necessitate darkness,  
a lowering of stimuli, for  
their subtle hum to be  
discernable.

should one aspire *to act with grandeur*?
