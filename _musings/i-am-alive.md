> I can't be a pessimist because I am 
alive. To be a pessimist means that you 
have agreed that human life is an 
academic matter. So, I am forced to be an 
optimist. I am forced to believe that we 
can survive, whatever we must survive.

We've come this far, and that's taken no
small series of miracles, and so much 
love from others, from ourselves. Cause
for optimism.
