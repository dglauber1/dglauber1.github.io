<cite>me of not quite four years ago:</cite>
<div class="poem" markdown="1">
> * i want to live into the flux of things,
> * not dwell in them. 
> * i want to experience living, not longing. 
> * i want to have a home in the present; 
> * to be held with love in every moment. 
</div>

i might amend this now to say, "<i>i want to 
experience living amidst my longing</i>"

the poem that i was riffing on is 
this one by <cite>Rainier Maria Rilke</cite>:
<div class="poem" markdown="1">
> * That is longing: to dwell in the flux of things,
> * To have no home in the present.
> &nbsp;\
> * And these are wishes: gentle dialogues
> * Of the poor hours with eternity. 
</div>
