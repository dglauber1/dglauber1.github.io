all below are from the wonderful novel by 
<cite>Kaveh Akbar:</cite>

> Love was a room that appeared when you 
stepped into it. Cyrus understood that now,
and stepped.

> ... we've always held the same obnoxious, 
rotten souls. Souls that have festered for 
millenia while science grew. ... How unfair,
this life. My wounds are so much deeper than 
yours. The arrogance of victimhood. Self-pity.
Suffocating.  
>  
> Maybe it's because we could pass along science. 
You wrote a fact in a book and there it sat until 
someone born five hundred years later improved
it. Refined it, implemented it more usefully. 
Easy. You couldn't do that with soul-learning. 
We all started from zero. From less than 
zero, actually. We started whiny, without 
grace. Obsessed only with our own needing. 
And the dead couldn't teach us anything about
that. No facts or tables or proofs. You just
had to live and suffer and then teach your 
kids to do the same. From a distance, habit 
passing for happiness. 

the above is written from the perspective of a rather
cynical character, and while i'm resistant to 
the pessimism put forth, i really like that
idea, that our ambitions don't need to be much 
more grand than a single lifetime's-worth of soul-learning 
merits.

> What distinguishes grace from everything else?
Grace is unearned. If you've moved through the world
in such a way as to feel you've earned cosmic 
compensation, then what you've earned is something
more like justice, like propriety. Not grace. 
Propriety is correct. Justice is just. There's an 
inescapable transactional quality: perform *x* good,
receive *y* reward. Grace doesn't work that way. It 
begins with the reward. Goodness never enters the 
equation. 

the above quotes are about or from the perspective
of, respectively, Cyrus, his father, and his mother.

> After that first kiss, I wouldn't have questioned
anything. Possibility, freedom. If a great winged 
angel had come up from the earth and burst apart, I
would have gathered its feathers. 

> He wanted, acutely in that moment, to be not-alive.
Not to be dead, not to kill himself, but to have the
burden of living lifted from his shoulders. 

> Lord, increase my bewilderment.

this is a Sufi prayer.

> It felt like the only time Cyrus ever really
felt now-ness was when he was using. When *now*
was physiologically, chemically discernible from
*before*. Otherwise he felt completely awash in
time: stuck between birth and death, an interval
where he'd never quite gotten his footing. But he
was also awash in the world and its checkboxes --
neither Iranian nor American, neither Muslim nor
not-Muslim, neither drunk nor in meaningful 
recovery, neither gay nor straight. Each camp 
thought he was too much the other thing. That 
there were camps at all made his head swim.

> Art is where what we survive survives.
