i probably shouldn't be on my phone right now.  
i'm having a mirage, which often means i'm about to have a migraine.  
it's kinda trippy.  
makes typing difficult though.  

lots of festivities happening in sf and 
oakland chinatowns today.  
cara is gonna drive us to see a dj in the city.  
though i feel rather reclusive, i think it'll 
be good for me to go.  

photography with a mirage is funny:
