> The smallest act in the most limited 
circumstances bears the seed of ... 
boundlessness, because one deed, and sometimes
one word, suffices to change every 
constellation.

~<cite>Hannah Arendt</cite>

I read this not as about the Butterfly 
Effect, how the smallest change can cascade 
into a grand magnitude of impact. No, this I 
feel is about the proportionality of an action
to its context.
It's easy to act grandly from a place of 
resourcing and freedom. Just as significant are
the small acts we make under limitation.
