<cite>Prentis Hemphill</cite> on love:
> I think love ... is when we will 
> another's existence ...  
> Willing another's existence could 
> happrn near or far, across time. It's 
> not force or control, but a light 
> and steady touch, a presence and 
> attention. The steadiness of love, 
> the will of it, is what gives it 
> weight, distinguishes it from the 
> thin love that Toni Morrison warns
> about in her novel **Beloved**. 
> To will someone is a generosity of
> our own spirit, a shift from scarcity, 
> a faith in connection. Love is a kind 
> of reunification.
