By <cite>W.B. Yeats</cite> (first stanza only)

<div markdown="1" class="poem">
> * Turning and turning in the widening gyre
> * The falcon cannot hear the falconer;
> * Things fall apart; the center cannot hold;
> * Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world,
> * The blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere
> * The ceremony of innocence is drowned;
> * The best lack all conviction, while the worst
> * Are full of passionate intensity.

*The best lack all conviction, while the worst  
Are full of passionate intensity.*
