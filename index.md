<cite>me of not quite four years ago:</cite>
> i want to live into the flux of things,\
> not dwell in them. \
> i want to experience living, not longing. \
> i want to have a home in the present; \
> to be held with love in every moment. 

i might amend this now to say, "<i>i want to 
experience living amidst my longing</i>"

the poem that i was riffing on is 
this one by <cite>Rainier Maria Rilke</cite>:
> That is longing: to dwell in the flux of things,\
> To have no home in the present.\
> And these are wishes: gentle dialogues\
> of the poor hours with eternity.
