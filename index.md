<div markdown="1" class="poem">
> * ### Endings
> * 
> * My life is composed of chapters
> * Of death and rebirth
> * Shedding and growing
> * Burning and beginning
> * I am not one to hang on
> * to fruits that are heavy and spoiling
> * Some have admired me for it
> * Some have resented me
> * But I have known freedom and peace
> * and the truths of my heart
> * too intimately
> * to stray from myself
> * When I travel back through the time
> tunnels of this life
> * all the versions of myself are bewildered
> * I shed what people have told me
> * that shrouded life's magic
> * I cut ties with others
> * when they became restraining
> * Burn it, bury it, compost it
> * Prepare the bed anew
> * for what you deep down bottom of your 
> yearn for
