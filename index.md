from Lama Rod Owens, in <u>The New Saints</u>:
> Our deepest wish is to be in love, to surrender to something that is not an old, familiar wave of grief, isolation, or fear. For me, love has involved a basic yet profound acceptance of who and what I am. It is the basic labor of allowing myself to be without judgment or policing. When I allow myself to be, then I can do the work of emotional labor, experiencing and metabolizing the pain to allow love to open back to space itself. Love is being myself and then wanting others to have the space to be themselves. When people have the space to be themselves, they can gain access to the resources they need to be well, happy, and safe. The space of acceptance is the soil from which our resources are gathered, like a harvest in autumn.\
> Love means we touch the ground of reality as it is, not as we want it to be. It is the labor of telling the truth and allowing the truth to tell us. And none of this is supposed to be easy. Allowing ourselves to expand the pain into the space and then to start identifying with the space is how love frees us.
