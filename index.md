> the truth is that there is no right 
answer. there is only what is right for 
you, what feels good to you, what you 
learn from each given situation, what
you take away from every experience. when 
you spend too much time dwelling on
answers you expect to be delivered to you,
you miss opportunities to find them within
yourself. you rob yourself of the chance 
to cultivate goodness for yourself. once 
we can learn to be so rooted in our 
entirety, this general acceptance feels a 
lot like cultivating a higher ground. a 
place where you can stand assured. a place
where you can look below at the contents of 
your life and breathe.
