website dreams
==============

##### 🌙🌒 late summer

i like having this website  
it gives me something to learn, to build,  
to track my days and progress,  
(though i want to maintain a dedication to letting them go)

to that end, i don’t want to build this website for posterity  
i’d like it to be easy to create and publish content, but i don’t need everything i’ve ever posted to be easily accessible. no, i’d rather prefer it be lost in the aether… 

anyway here’s me today:
