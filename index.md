title: why love in a time of war?

war is mounting overseas in a way that
has me fearful, grieving in a way that
feels unprecedented, personally. 

my mind questions why i might still be
pursuing love and connection during a time
like this. this poem, 
<u>Crossing Half of China to Sleep with You</u>
by <cite>余秀华</cite> and translated by
<cite>Ming Di</cite> validates so much of
what i'm feeling:

<div markdown="1" class="poem">
> * To sleep with you or to be slept, 
> what's the difference if there's any?
> * Two bodies collide -- the force, the 
> flower pushed open by 
> * &nbsp;&nbsp; the force,
> * the virtual spring in the flowering --
> nothing more than this
> * and this we mistake as life
> restarting. In half of China
> * things are happening: volcanoes
> * erupting, rivers running dry,
> * political prisoners and displaced
> workers abandoned,
> * elk deer and red-crowned cranes shot.
> * I cross the hail of bullets to sleep
> with you.
> * I press many nights into one morning
> to sleep with you.
> * I run across many of me and many of me
> run into one to sleep
> * &nbsp;&nbsp; with you.
> * Yet I can be misled by butterflies
> of course
> * and mistake praise as spring,
> * a village like Hengdian as home. But
> all these,
> * all of these are absolutely indispensable
> * reasons that I sleep with you.
