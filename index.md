i've come across writings in the past 
that lead me to believe that joy and 
grief are inextricable - two sides of the 
same coin. here's another, from, yet
again, <cite>Prentis Hemphill</cite>, who
quotes their friend <cite>Malkia 
Devich-Cyril</cite>:
> Joy is not the opposite of grief. 
> Grief is the opposite of indifference. 
> Grief is an evolutionary indicator of
> love---the kind of great love that
> guides revolutionaries. 
grief is the opposite of indifference. 
joy, i feel, is investment in pleasure, 
rather than indifference to it.
