title: Kahlil Gibran on Freedom
time: ğŸŒ–
---
> You can only be free when even the
> desire of seeking freedom becomes a 
> harness to you, and when you cease 
> to speak of freedom as a goal and a
> fulfillment. 
> 
> You shall be free indeed when your 
> days are not without a care nor your 
> nights without a want and a grief,  
> But rather when these things girdle 
> your life and yet you rise above them 
> naked and unbound.
