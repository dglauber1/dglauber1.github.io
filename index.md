the culture of whiteness 
is not really a culture
but a script
a set of rules. 
the script - of whiteness - 
that i carry
will hurt you
just as yours me

to be accountable to that 
we need to be in a culture 
of feedback
of bravery
of freedom
of choice

whirling movements
of whirling grace

thru the thick and the thin
the slime and the sludge

hunger-driven
silent as a knife
