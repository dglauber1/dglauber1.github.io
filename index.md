this site has come about through  
a process of mothering.  
maybe i had some loose vision,  
but for the most part,  
i've put in care every day,  
not knowing how things would turn out.  
it's still a work in progress.  
some leaps are worth making.  
many are misguided.  
e.g. in applying for jobs in seattle,  
i became enamored yesterday by the idea  
of working as a web developer at UW.  
applying for this job now feels like  
i'd need to shoehorn myself into  
appearing qualified,  
into wanting it for professionally\
acceptable reasons.  
into working full time.  
could you imagine??  
maybe you can, but idk, i know that on\
a day like today, when i'm sleep-deprived\
and the weather is gloomy,\
waking up to an alarm and commuting to\
work would take heroic levels of\
shoehorning.  
mothering is different from shoehorning.  
mothering meets a growing thing  
where it's at.  
and where i'm at today is tired.  
without the capacity to dream far beyond\
where my current lifestyle allows.  

i do want prosperity, of course.  
i've worked to develop a strong inner \
sense of prosperity.  
and now i want my material conditions\
to match.  
i've been losing money each month,  
for a good many years.  
there's something to be said for \
living frugally and centering \
my sense of stability in the \
abundance around me.  
and somehow,  
i'm curious to know \
a stable paycheck again.  
*sigh...*

ramble ramble

it's time to get off the toilet lol\
i feel like going for a ride on my bike.  
maybe a nap, first.
