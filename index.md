By Mary Oliver:
> One day you finally knew\
> what you had to do, and began,\
> though the voices around you \
> kept shouting\
> their bad advice - \
> though the whole house\
> began to tremble\
> and you felt the old tug\
> at your ankles. \
> "Mend my life!"\
> each voice cried. \
> But you didn't stop. \
> You knew what you had to do,\
> though the wind pried\
> with its stiff fingers\
> at the very foundations,\
> though their melancholy\
> was terrible. \
> It was already late\
> enough, and a wild night,\
> and the road full of fallen\
> branches and stones. \
> But little by little,\
> as you left their voices behind,\
> the stars began to burn\
> through the sheets of clouds,\
> and there was a new voice\
> which you slowly \
> recognized as your own,\
> that kept you company\
> as you strode deeper and deeper\
> into the world,\
> determined to do\
> the only thing you could do-\
> determined to save\
> the only life that you could save.
