</header>
<p>feeling deeply lazy these days.<br />
perhaps it’s that i’m weaning myself off coffee.<br />
perhaps it’s that i’m moving towards a period and a 
place far from the bay area community to which i’ve 
become accustomed.</p>

<p>a sense of abundance is there, here - i can feel into 
it when i focus on it, actively remember it.<br />
and still, the little costs of change worry me.<br />
change is hard; change is always hard. remembering 
that allows me to give grace to this moment, 
to this moment for feeling tough. 
the future holds great change, and with it 
great cost. great grief. may i accept and release 
it all with quiet gratitude.</p>

<p>there’s brightness ahead, too.<br />
there’s brightness here, too.</p>
