	<h1>mothering prosperity ramble</h1>
</header>
<p>this site has come about through<br />
a process of mothering.<br />
maybe i had some loose vision,<br />
but for the most part,<br />
i’ve put in care every day,<br />
not knowing how things would turn out.<br />
it’s still a work in progress.<br />
some leaps are worth making.<br />
many are misguided.<br />
e.g. in applying for jobs in seattle,<br />
i became enamored yesterday by the idea<br />
of working as a web developer at UW.<br />
applying for this job now feels like<br />
i’d need to shoehorn myself into<br />
appearing qualified,<br />
into wanting it for professionally<br />
acceptable reasons.<br />
into working full time.<br />
could you imagine??<br />
maybe you can, but idk, i know that on<br />
a day like today, when i’m sleep-deprived<br />
and the weather is gloomy,<br />
waking up to an alarm and commuting to<br />
work would take heroic levels of<br />
shoehorning.<br />
mothering is different from shoehorning.<br />
mothering meets a growing thing<br />
where it’s at.<br />
and where i’m at today is tired.<br />
without the capacity to dream far beyond<br />
where my current lifestyle allows.</p>

<p>i do want prosperity, of course.<br />
i’ve worked to develop a strong inner <br />
sense of prosperity.<br />
and now i want my material conditions<br />
to match.<br />
i’ve been losing money each month,<br />
for a good many years.<br />
there’s something to be said for <br />
living frugally and centering <br />
my sense of stability in the <br />
abundance around me.<br />
and somehow,<br />
i’m curious to know <br />
a stable paycheck again.<br />
<em>sigh…</em></p>

<p>ramble ramble</p>

<p>it’s time to get off the toilet lol<br />
i feel like going for a ride on my bike.<br />
maybe a nap, first.</p>
