	<h1>aura</h1>
</header>
<p>i probably shouldn’t be on my phone right now.<br />
i’m having an aura, which often means i’m about to have a migraine.<br />
it’s kinda trippy.<br />
makes typing difficult though.</p>

<p>lots of festivities happening in sf and 
oakland chinatowns today.<br />
cara is gonna drive us to see a dj in the city.<br />
though i feel rather reclusive, i think it’ll 
be good for me to go.</p>

<p>photography with an aura is funny:<br />
<img src="/assets/images/pink_quarry_flowers.jpg" alt="vibrant pink flowers framed by green lawn and trees" title="is it my aura or does the pink of these flowers really POP?" /></p>

<p>too bad i can’t think of some topical aura pun…<br />
my aura so strong it’s blinding<br />
i’m so sorry<br />
this is over now<br />
goodbye</p>
