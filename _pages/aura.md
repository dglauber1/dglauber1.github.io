i probably shouldn't be on my phone right now.  
i'm having an aura, which often means i'm about to have a migraine.  
it's kinda trippy.  
makes typing difficult though.  

lots of festivities happening in sf and 
oakland chinatowns today.  
cara is gonna drive us to see a dj in the city.  
though i feel rather reclusive, i think it'll 
be good for me to go.  

photography with an aura is funny:  
![vibrant pink flowers framed by green lawn and trees](/assets/images/pink_quarry_flowers.jpg "is it my aura or does the pink of these flowers really POP?")

too bad i can't think of some topical aura pun...  
my aura so strong it's blinding  
i'm so sorry  
this is over now  
goodbye
